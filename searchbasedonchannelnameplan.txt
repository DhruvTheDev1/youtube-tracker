- Implementing feature that allows to use the search API based on channel name and also ID too if they like
- Instead of entering channel ID which is impracticle - it will display channels for the user to pick


User enters Input in form -> is input channel ID or name
If channelID -> calls existing /youtube-tracker endpoint

If channelName -> calls YTSearchAPI -> 
JSON Response:
items[]:
- title
- channelID
- thumbnail
- vice versa...

-> Display list of channels
[thumbnail] channelName
            channelID

[thumbnail2] channelName2
            channelID2
...

-> User selects a channel -> sends selected channelID to /youtube-tracker endpoint
-> displays results
